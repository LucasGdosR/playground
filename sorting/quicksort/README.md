Quicksort is an efficient comparison sort algorithm devised by Tony Hoare in
1959. It features a Divide and Conquer design, and works by recursively
partitioning and reordering the input array according to a _pivot_ element.

Quicksort presents a slightly better performance than other comparison sort
algorithms such as Merge Sort and Heapsort.

## Algorithm

1. If the array is shorter than two elements, stop recursing.
2. Select an element in the array and call it the _pivot_ element.
3. Partition and reorder the array into two sub-arrays, such that the elements
that are less than the _pivot_ come before the division point and elements
greater than the _pivot_ come after it. Elements that equal the _pivot_ can be
placed on either of the partitions.
4. Recursively apply Steps 1 -- 3 in the the left and right sub-arrays.
5. When the recursion ends, the array is sorted.

## Performance

- Best-Case: $O(n \log_2 n)$ comparisons
- Worst-Case: $O(n^2)$ comparisons
